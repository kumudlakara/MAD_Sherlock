# MAD-Sherlock: MultiAgent Debates for Misinformation Detection based on Out of Context Image Use
This repository contains the code for MAD-Sherlock. It contains all the notebooks as well as final scripts used to replicate the results. This project has been developed as part of my master's thesis for the MSc in Advanced Computer Science course at the University of Oxford. 

The main goal of this project is to develop an autonomous AI agent capable of detecting as well as explaining instances of misinformation on the internet. It uses an external retrieval module to form an understanding of the original context in which the image appears on the Internet. This helps the system better explain its predictions.
