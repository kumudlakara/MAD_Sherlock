Many say that it was the city that set the precedent of creating a 'legacy\" from a major sporting event.  In the last part of our series on the Commonwealth Games and regeneration, Lisa Summers looks at what Glasgow can learn from Manchester, where development continues 12 years down the line.Like Glasgow, Manchester is a city built on heavy industry. It too has issues with poverty and high unemployment, and it is a city that loves its sport.In 2002, the Commonwealth Games kicked off a huge regeneration project in the east of Manchester - concentrated in the areas of Clayton and Beswick.At the heart of that regeneration was \"Sport City\", home now to the Ethiad, Manchester City Football Club's home ground, the National Squash centre, an athletics track, tennis centre and across the road, the \"medal factory\" as they call it, the Velodrome.  Even now, the development continues. From a vantage point on top of a new sixth form college still under construction - the panorama tells the story of the games - as does the leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese.Image caption, The City of Manchester stadium, now known as the Etihad, was constructed especially for the 2002 Commonwealth Games\"What the Commonwealth Games gave us and what Sport City gave us was a focus for regeneration, it gave people pride in the area, it gave people a belief that the area had a future. And we see here that 12 years later, notwithstanding the recession, that regeneration is still taking place here.\"But simply walk over the road from the famous venues and the picture is not quite so rosy. The crime rate in Clayton is more than double the national average and unemployment remains high.  For lifelong Manchester resident Andrea Broad, the Commonwealth Games is not so impressive. She says buildings are still crumbling and she has seen no sign of investment in jobs. \"There's the streets behind me, and all the jobs and everything, I don't think they go to the locals at all,\" she says. \"There's plenty of people around here unemployed.\"Another local resident, Kareen Smith's view is the same: \"If you are going to build something in the community that benefits the community shouldn't they get to apply for jobs first?\"Image caption, Manchester's city centre still benefits from the investment made for the 2002 Commonwealth GamesBoth acknowledge that the sports facilities are well used.  Their children are regular visitors to the Velodrome where there are waiting lists for community taster sessions. Away from the east of the city, the transport infrastructure that the Games brought has allowed the whole of the city to benefit.  An extension of the tram line was funded by the Games. Broadly speaking Manchester is considered a success story. Professor Kevin Ward is from Manchester University and an expert on urban regeneration: \"I think it has managed to regenerate the east of the city. It's managed to pull in Manchester City football club, and it's created some of the jobs that it wanted to create all those years ago.\"  But Professor Ward does concede that Manchester could have been better at consulting with the local community about how they wanted to benefit from the cash injection around the Games. That is something he believes is happening in Glasgow.The Commonwealth Games can provide a lucrative hook for regeneration, the question for Glasgow, long after the Commonwealth Games is gone, is will it mean lasting change?

      "        Celtic Park will host the opening ceremony of 2014 Commonwealth Games tonight as 71 nations start their battle for supremacy. Celtic on the other hand had to leave their home for at least one major game.AdvertisementTonight at 8pm local time Glasgow will be the site of 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. The event will be launched at Celtic Park, Scotland’s largest football stadium. However, for the ceremony capacity has fallen to under 40,000 due to stage layout.\n",
      "The entire main grandstand was sealed off as a massive LED screen has been set covering it. 100 meters long and 11m high the screen is a record-breaker for Europe in terms of covered surface and will become a ‘window on the world’.71 nations are to be represented in the 10-day-long Games, including Malaysia. The reason for singling it out is of course recent airplane disaster in Ukraine. 298 victims of that tragedy are to be commemorated tonight, during the ceremony.\n",
      "While Celtic Park is used for Commonwealth Games, Celtic had to relocate. Initially it was planned the club will play both the 2nd and 3rd round of UEFA Champions League qualifiers at Edinburgh’s Murrayfield, but there’s a chance the latter phase will be possible to play in Glasgow, because the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony on August 3 will be held at Hampden, not Celtic Park.Advertisement\n",
