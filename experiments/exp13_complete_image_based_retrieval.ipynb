      "                    - The House of Commons Scottish Affairs committee has been investigating the use of the Consulting Association by major contractors to prevent suspected \"troublemakers\" from getting jobs in the industry.\n",
      "                    - The committee has described the practice as an \"organized conspiracy\" by big construction firms to discriminate against workers who raised legitimate grievances over health and safety and other industrial issues.\n",
      "                    - The committee has received written evidence and held a formal committee hearing on the 3rd of July with Gail Cartmail of Unite the Union, who has given what they believe to be clear proof that blacklisting for trade union and health and safety activities has been going on within the Crossrail project.\n",
      "                    - The Consulting Association was shut down by the Information Commissioner in 2009.\n",
      "                    - The scale of the blacklist may be far larger than previously thought and goes well beyond the construction industry.\n",
      "                    - Evidence from the ICO at a Scottish select committee inquiry into blacklisting suggests there is far more yet to come to light.\n",
      "                    - The ICO has admitted it \"could have done more\" to contact the workers it knows are on the blacklist, and that companies may have lied to its investigators about their use of the blacklist.\n",
      "                    - The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) has told its members to clamp down on tax abuse and exploitation of workers via umbrella companies, amid growing pressure for regulation of temporary labor.\n",
      "                    - The use of umbrella companies is legal, but unscrupulous providers have been found to skim money from workers through dubious means like hidden fees or holding back holiday pay.\n",
      "                    - The issue has caught the attention of MPs, unions, and campaigners, and there is a need for urgent action to regulate umbrella companies to give \"greater protection to the some 600,000 people who are being exposed to employment rights abuses and lost income through unethical, but not yet illegal payslip skims and scams.\"\n"
